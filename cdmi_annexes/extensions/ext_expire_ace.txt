Expiring access control entries (ACEs)
**************************************

Overview
--------

A common trait of cloud storage services is the ability to share an object with other clients for a limited time. This extension adds an attribute of ACEs used in ACLs that imposes a time limit (expiration) on the ACE. Once the ACE expires, the ACE is no longer valid or included in the authorization calculation for the object.

Changes to specification
------------------------

Insert into :numref:`%s <ref_acl_evaluation>`:

    After the bullet item:
    
    * ACEs that do not refer to the principal P requesting the operation are ignored.

    Insert bullet:

    * ACEs that have an expiration value less than the current time are ignored.

Change :numref:`%s <ref_acl_evaluation>`:

    Original text:

    .. code-block:: bnf

        ACE = { acetype , identifier , aceflags , acemask , acetime }

    Revised text:

    .. code-block:: bnf

        ACE = { acetype , identifier , aceflags , acemask , acetime, expiration }

Insert into :numref:`%s <ref_acl_evaluation>` after "``acemask = uint_t | acemaskstring``":

    .. code-block:: bnf

        expiration = uint_t

Insert into :numref:`%s <ref_acl_evaluation>` after "When ACE masks...":

    When ACE expiration is presented in string format, it shall be specified in ISO-8601 point-in-time format as described in :numref:`%s <ref_time_representations>`.

Insert a new sub-clause after :numref:`%s <ref_acl_json_format>`: "ACE expiration"

   An ACE may have an optional expiration associated with it. The expiration is a point-in-time value, in ISO-8601 point-in-time format, as described in :numref:`%s <ref_time_representations>`, which specifies that the ACE is no longer valid and shall be ignored after the time specified.
