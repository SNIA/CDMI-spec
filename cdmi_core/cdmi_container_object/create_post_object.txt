Create (POST) a New Data Object using CDMI
******************************************

Synopsis
--------

To create a new data object in a specified container, the following request shall be performed:

* ``POST <root URI>/<ContainerName>/``

To create a new data object where the data object does not belong to a container and is only accessible by ID (see :numref:`%s <ref_object_model_for_cdmi>`), the following request shall be performed:

* ``POST <root URI>/cdmi_objectid/``

Where:

* ``<root URI>`` is the path to the CDMI cloud.
* ``<ContainerName>`` is zero or more intermediate container objects that already exist, with one slash (i.e., "``/``") between each pair of container object names.
* ``<DataObjectName>`` is the name specified for the data object to be created.

If created in a container, the data object shall be accessible as a child of the container with a server-assigned name, and shall also be accessible at ``<root URI>/cdmi_objectid/<objectID>``. 

If created in "``/cdmi_objectid/``", the data object shall only be accessible at ``<root URI>/cdmi_objectid/<objectID>``. 

Delayed Completion of Create
----------------------------

In response to a create operation for a data object, the server may return an HTTP status code of ``202 Accepted`` to indicate that the object is in the process of being created. This response is useful for long-running operations (e.g., copying a large data object from a source URI). Such a response has the following implications.

* The server shall return a Location header with an absolute URI to the object to be created along with an HTTP status code of ``202 Accepted``.
* With an HTTP status code of ``202 Accepted``, the server implies that the following checks have passed:

  * user authorization for creating the object;
  * user authorization for read access to any source object for move, copy, serialize, or deserialize; and
  * availability of space to create the object or at least enough space to create a URI to report an error.

* A client might not be able to immediately access the created object, e.g., due to delays resulting from the implementationâ€™s use of eventual consistency. 

The client performs GET operations to the URI to track the progress of the operation. In response, the server returns two fields in its response body to indicate progress.

* A mandatory ``completionStatus`` text field contains either "``Processing``", "``Complete``", or an error string starting with the value "``Error``".
* An optional ``percentComplete`` field contains the percentage of the operation that has completed (0 to 100). 

GET shall not return any value for the data object when ``completionStatus`` is not "``Complete``". If the final result of the create operation is an error, the URI is created with the ``completionStatus`` field set to the error message. It is the client's responsibility to delete the URI after the error has been noted.

      - JSON String
      - URI of a CDMI data object that shall be redirected to by a reference. If any other fields are supplied when creating a reference, the server shall respond with an HTTP status code of ``400 Bad Request``.

      - JSON String
      - A data object serialized as specified in :numref:`Clause %s <clause_cdmi_serialization>` and encoded using base 64 encoding rules described in RFC 4648 :cite:`rfc4648`, that shall be deserialized to create the new data object.

          * If multi-part MIME is being used and this field contains the value of the MIME boundary parameter, the contents of the second MIME part shall be assigned as the field value.

          * "``base64``" indicates that the data object may contain arbitrary binary sequences, and it shall be transported as a base 64-encoded string in the value field. Setting the contents of the data object value field to any value other than a valid base 64 string shall result in an HTTP status code of ``400 Bad Request`` being returned to the client.
          * "``json``" indicates that the data object contains a valid JSON object, and the ``value`` field shall be a JSON object containing valid JSON data. If the contents of the ``value`` field are set to any value other than a valid JSON object, an HTTP status code of ``400 Bad Request`` shall be returned to the client.

          * If this field is not included and multi-part MIME is being used, the value of "``utf-8``" shall be assigned as the field value if the Content-Type header of the second and all MIME parts includes the charset parameter as defined in RFC 2046 of "``utf-8``" (e.g., "``;charset=utf-8``"). Otherwise, the value of "``base64``" shall be assigned as the field value. This field applies only to the encoding of the value when represented in JSON; the ``Content-Transfer-Encoding`` header of the part specifies the encoding of the value within a multi-part MIME request, as defined in RFC 2045 :cite:`rfc2045`.
          * This field shall be stored as part of the object.
      - Optional [#a]_
    * - value
      - JSON String

          * If this field is not included and multi-part MIME is not being used, an empty JSON String (i.e., "") shall be assigned as the field value.
          * If this field is not included and multi-part MIME is being used, the contents of the second MIME part shall be assigned as the field value.
          * If the ``valuetransferencoding`` field indicates UTF-8 encoding, the value shall be a UTF-8 string escaped using the JSON escaping rules described in RFC 4627 :cite:`rfc4627`.
          * If the ``valuetransferencoding`` field indicates base 64 encoding, the value shall be first encoded using the base 64 encoding rules described inÂ RFC 4648 :cite:`rfc4648`.
          * If the ``valuetransferencoding`` field indicates JSON encoding, the value shall contain a valid JSON object.
      - Optional [#a]_

.. [#a] Only one of these fields shall be specified in any given operation. Except for value, these fields shall not be stored. If more than one of these fields is supplied, the server shall respond with an HTTP status code of ``400 Bad Request``.

      - The request contains invalid parameters or field names.
    * - ``401 Unauthorized``
      - The authentication credentials are missing or invalid.
    * - ``403 Forbidden``
      - The client lacks the proper authorization to perform this request.
    * - ``404 Not Found``
      - The resource was not found at the specified URI.
    * - ``409 Conflict``
      - The operation conflicts with a non-CDMI access protocol lock or may cause a state transition error on the server.
