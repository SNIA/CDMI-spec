Create (POST) a New Data Object using CDMI
******************************************


Synopsis
--------

To create a new data object in a specified container where the name of the data object is a server-assigned object identifier, the following request shall be performed:

    POST <root URI>/<ContainerName>/

To create a new data object where the data object does not belong to a container and is only accessible by ID (see :numref:`ref_object_model_for_cdmi`), the following request shall be performed:

    POST <root URI>/cdmi_objectid/

Where:


* <root URI> is the path to the CDMI cloud.
* <ContainerName> is zero or more intermediate container objects that already exist, with one slash (i.e., "/") between each pair of container object names.


If created in "/cdmi_objectid/", the data object shall be accessible at <root URI>/cdmi_objectid/<objectID>. 

If created in a container, the data object shall be accessible as a child of the container with a server-assigned name, and shall also be accessible at <root URI>/cdmi_objectid/<objectID>. 


Delayed Completion of Create
----------------------------

In response to a create operation for a data object, the server may return an HTTP status code of ``202 Accepted`` to indicate that the object is in the process of being created. This response is useful for long-running operations (e.g., copying a large data object from a source URI). Such a response has the following implications.


* The server shall return a Location header with an absolute URI to the object to be created along with an HTTP status code of ``202 Accepted``.
* With an HTTP status code of ``202 Accepted``, the server implies that the following checks have passed:
   - user authorization for creating the object;
   - user authorization for read access to any source object for move, copy, serialize, or deserialize; and
   - availability of space to create the object or at least enough space to create a URI to report an error.
* A client might not be able to immediately access the created object, e.g., due to delays resulting from the implementation’s use of eventual consistency. 


The client performs GET operations to the URI to track the progress of the operation. In response, the server returns two fields in its response body to indicate progress.


* A mandatory completionStatus text field contains either "Processing", "Complete", or an error string starting with the value "Error".
* An optional percentComplete field contains the percentage that the Accepted POST has completed (0 to 100). 


GET does not return any value for the object when completionStatus is not "Complete". When the final result of the create operation is an error, the URI is created with the completionStatus field set to the error message. It is the client's responsibility to delete the URI after the error has been noted.


Capabilities 
------------

The following capabilities describe the supported operations that may be performed when creating a new data object by ID in "/cdmi_objectid/": 


* Support for the ability to create data objects through this operation is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_post_dataobject_by_ID system capability. 
* If the object being created in "/cdmi_objectid/" is a reference, support for that ability is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_create_reference_by_ID system capability. 
* If the new data object being created in "/cdmi_objectid/" is a copy of an existing data object, support for the ability to copy is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_copy_dataobject_by_ID system capability. 
* If the new data object being created in "/cdmi_objectid/" is the destination of a move, support for the ability to move the data object to "/cdmi_objectid/" is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_object_move_to_ID system capability. 
* If the new data object being created in "/cdmi_objectid/" is the destination of a deserialization operation, support for the ability to deserialize the data object is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_deserialize_dataobject_by_ID system capability. 
* If the new data object being created in "/cdmi_objectid/" is the destination of a serialize operation, support for the ability to serialize the data object is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_serialize_dataobject_to_ID, cdmi_serialize_container_to_ID, cdmi_serialize_domain_to_ID, or cdmi_serialize_queue_to_ID system capabilities. 


The following capabilities describe the supported operations that may be performed when creating a new data object by ID in a container: 


* Support for the ability to create data objects through this operation is indicated by the presence of both the cdmi_post_dataobject and the cdmi_create_dataobject capabilities in the specified container object. 
* If the object being created in the parent container object is a reference, support for that ability is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_create_reference capability in the parent container object. 
* If the new data object is a copy of an existing data object, support for the ability to copy is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_copy_dataobject capability in the parent container object. 
* If the new data object is the destination of a move, support for the ability to move the data object is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_move_dataobject capability in the parent container object. 
* If the new data object is the destination of a deserialize operation, support for the ability to deserialize the the data object is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_deserialize_dataobject capability in the parent container object. 
* If the new data object is the destination of a serialize operation, support for the ability to serialize the source data object is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_serialize_dataobject, cdmi_serialize_container, cdmi_serialize_domain, or cdmi_serialize_queue capabilities in the parent container object.
