Create (POST) a New Queue Object using CDMI
*******************************************


Synopsis
--------

To create a new queue object (see :numref:`ref_queue_object_resource_operations_using_cdmi`) in a specified container where the name of the queue object is a server-assigned object identifier, the following request shall be performed:

    POST <root URI>/<ContainerName>/

To create a new queue object where the queue object does not belong to a container and is only accessible by ID (see :numref:`ref_object_model_for_cdmi`), the following request shall be performed:

    POST <root URI>/cdmi_objectid/

Where:


* <root URI> is the path to the CDMI cloud.
* <ContainerName> is zero or more intermediate container objects that already exist, with one slash (i.e., "/") between each pair of container object names.


If created in "/cdmi_objectid/", the queue object shall be accessible at <root URI>/cdmi_objectid/<objectID>. 

If created in a container, the queue object shall be accessible as a child of the container with a server-assigned name, and shall also be accessible at <root URI>/cdmi_objectid/<objectID>.


Delayed Completion of Create
----------------------------

On a create operation for a queue object, the server may return an HTTP status code of ``202 Accepted``. In this case, the object is in the process of being created. This response is particularly useful for long-running operations, e.g., copying a large number of queue values from a source URI. Such a response has the following implications:


* The server shall return a Location header with an absolute URI to the object to be created along with an HTTP status code of ``202 Accepted``.
* With an HTTP status code of ``202 Accepted``, the server implies that the following checks have passed:
   - user authorization for creating the object;
   - user authorization for read access to any source object for move, copy, serialize, or deserialize; and
   - availability of space to create the object or at least enough space to create a URI to report an error.
* A client might not be able to immediately access the created object, e.g., due to delays resulting from the implementationâ€™s use of eventual consistency.


The client performs GET operations to the URI to track the progress of the operation. In response, the server returns two fields in its response body to indicate progress.


* A mandatory completionStatus text field contains either "Processing", "Complete", or an error string starting with the value "Error".
* An optional percentComplete field contains the percentage that the accepted POST has completed (0 to 100).


GET does not return any value for the object when completionStatus is not "Complete". When the final result of the create operation is an error, the URI is created with the completionStatus field set to the error message. It is the client's responsibility to delete the URI after the error has been noted.


Capabilities
------------

The following capabilities describe the supported operations that may be performed when creating a new queue object by ID in "/cdmi_objectid/": 


* Support for the ability to create queue objects through this operation is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_post_queue_by_ID system capability. 
* If the object being created in "/cdmi_objectid/" is a reference, support for that ability is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_create_reference_by_ID system capability. 
* If the new queue object being created in "/cdmi_objectid/" is a copy of an existing queue object, support for the ability to copy is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_copy_queue_by_ID system capability. 
* If the new queue object being created in "/cdmi_objectid/" is the destination of a move, support for the ability to move the data object to "/cdmi_objectid/" is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_object_move_to_ID system capability. 
* If the new queue object being created in "/cdmi_objectid/" is the destination of a deserialization operation, support for the ability to deserialize the data object is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_deserialize_queue_by_ID system capability. 
* If the new data object is being created in "/cdmi_objectid/", support for the ability to create the value of the new data object in specified byte ranges is indicated by the presence of the "cdmi_create_value_range_by_ID" system capability.
* If the new data object is being created in a container object, support for the ability to create the value of the new data object in specified byte ranges is indicated by the presence of the "cdmi_create_value_range" capability in the parent container.


The following capabilities describe the supported operations that may be performed when creating a new queue object by ID in a container:


* Support for the ability to create queue objects through this operation is indicated by the presence of both the cdmi_post_queue and cdmi_create_queue capabilities in the specified container object.
* If the object being created in the parent container object is a reference, support for that ability is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_create_reference capability in the parent container object.
* If the new queue object is a copy of an existing queue object, support for the ability to copy is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_copy_queue capability in the parent container object.
* If the new queue object is the destination of a move, support for the ability to move the queue object is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_move_queue capability in the parent container object.
* If the new queue object is the destination of a deserialize operation, support for the ability to deserialize the the queue object is indicated by the presence of the cdmi_deserialize_queue capability in the parent container object.

#.  POST to the container object URI the queue object contents:

    .. code-block:: http

        POST /MyContainer/ HTTP/1.1
