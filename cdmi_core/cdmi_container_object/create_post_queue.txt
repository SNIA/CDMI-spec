.. _ref_cdmi_container_object_create_post_queue:

Create (POST) a new queue object using CDMI
*******************************************

Synopsis
--------

To create a new queue object (see :numref:`Clause %s <clause_cdmi_queue_object>`) in a specified container where the name of the queue object is a server-assigned object identifier, the following request shall be performed:

* ``POST <root URI>/<ContainerName>/``

To create a new queue object where the queue object does not belong to a container and is only accessible by ID (see :numref:`%s <ref_object_model_for_cdmi>`), the following request shall be performed:

* ``POST <root URI>/cdmi_objectid/``

Where:

* ``<root URI>`` is the path to the CDMI cloud.
* ``<ContainerName>`` is zero or more intermediate container objects that already exist, with one slash (i.e., "``/``") between each pair of container object names.

If created in a container, the queue object shall be accessible as a child of the container with a server-assigned name, and shall also be accessible at ``<root URI>/cdmi_objectid/<objectID>``. 

If created in "``/cdmi_objectid/``", the queue object shall only be accessible at ``<root URI>/cdmi_objectid/<objectID>``. 

Delayed completion of create
----------------------------

In response to a create operation for a queue object, the server may return an HTTP status code of ``202 Accepted`` to indicate that the object is in the process of being created. This response is useful for long-running operations (e.g., copying a large number of queue values from a source URI). Such a response has the following implications.

* The server shall return a Location header with an absolute URI to the object to be created along with an HTTP status code of ``202 Accepted``.
* With an HTTP status code of ``202 Accepted``, the server implies that the following checks have passed:

  * user authorization for creating the object;
  * user authorization for read access to any source object for move, copy, serialize, or deserialize; and
  * availability of space to create the object or at least enough space to create a URI to report an error.

* A client might not be able to immediately access the created object, e.g., due to delays resulting from the implementationâ€™s use of eventual consistency.

The client performs GET operations to the URI to track the progress of the operation. In response, the server returns two fields in its response body to indicate progress.

* A mandatory ``completionStatus`` text field contains either "``Processing``", "``Complete``", or an error string starting with the value "``Error``".
* An optional ``percentComplete`` field contains the percentage of the operation that has completed (0 to 100). 

GET shall not return any value for the queue object when ``completionStatus`` is not "``Complete``". If the final result of the create operation is an error, the URI is created with the ``completionStatus`` field set to the error message. It is the client's responsibility to delete the URI after the error has been noted.

EXAMPLE 1: POST to the container object URI the queue object contents:

    .. code-block:: none

        POST /MyContainer/ HTTP/1.1
