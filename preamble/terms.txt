         The mimetype for this object is application/cdmi-container.

         The mimetype for this object is application/cdmi-domain.



    CDMI object
         one of CDMI capabilities, CDMI container, CDMI data object, CDMI domain, or CDMI queue

    Data Storage as a Service
    DSaaS
         delivery of virtualized storage and data services on demand over a network, based on a request for a given service level that hides limits to scalability, is either self-provisioned or provisionless, and is billed based on consumption

    delegated access control
    DAC
         the process of delegating an access control decision to a third party
         
    delegated access control provider
    DAC provider

    DAC request
         a request made to a DAC provider for an access control decision
         
    delegated access control response
    DAC response
         a response from a DAC provider indicating the result of a request for an access control decision
         
    domain
         a shared user authorization database that contains users, groups, and their security policies and associated accounting information

         Each CDMI object belongs to a single domain, and each domain provides user mapping and accounting information.
