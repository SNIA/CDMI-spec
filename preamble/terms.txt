         delivery of virtualized storage and data services on demand over a network, based on a request for a given service level that hides limits to scalability, is either self-provisioned or provisionless, and is billed based on consumption

         the process of delegating an access control decision to a third party

    delegated access control response (DAC response)
         a response from a DAC provider indicating the result of a request for an access control decision
         
    domain
         a shared user authorization database that contains users, groups, and their security policies and associated accounting information

         Each CDMI object belongs to a single domain, and each domain provides user mapping and accounting information.

    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
         delivery over a network of an appropriately configured virtual computing environment, based on a request for a given service level

         Typically, IaaS is either self-provisioned or provisionless and is billed based on consumption.
