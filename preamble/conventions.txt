Interface format
****************

Each interface description has nine components, as described in :numref:`tbl_interface_format`.

.. _tbl_interface_format:

.. list-table:: Interface format
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 30 70
    :align: center

    * - Component
      - Description
    * - Synopsis
      - The GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, and DELETE semantics
    * - Delayed completion
      - For long-running operations, a description of behavior when the operation does not immediately complete
    * - Capabilities
      - A description of the supported operations
    * - Request headers
      - The request headers, such as Accept, Authorization, Content-Length, Content-Type
    * - Request message body
      - A description of the message body contents
    * - Response headers
      - The response headers, such as Content-Length, Content-Type
    * - Response message body
      - A description of the message body contents
    * - Response Status
      - A list of HTTP status codes

*************************
Typographical conventions
*************************

All code text and HTTP status codes are shown in a fixed-width font, as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    PUT /MyContainer/MyDataObject.txt HTTP/1.1
    Host: cloud.example.com
    Accept: application/cdmi-object
    Content-Type: application/cdmi-object

    {
      "mimetype" : "text/plain",
      "metadata" : {

      },
      "value" : "This is the Value of this Data Object"
    }

Requesting an optional field that is not present shall result in an HTTP status code of ``404 Not Found``.

Similarly, precise literals are shown in a fixed-width font. For example:

* The assignment of a particular value, or reference to a particular field: 'Field ``n`` shall be set to ``true``';
* String literals: 'and user metadata names shall not begin with the prefix “``cdmi_``”.';
* Property, attribute, or capability names: 'This requirement shall be understood in the context that access by object ID is predicated on the
873 presence of the ``cdmi_object_access_by_ID`` capability.'.


**************************************
Request and response body requirements
**************************************

In request and response body tables, the Requirement column contains one of the following three values:

* Mandatory. The value specified in this row shall be provided.
* Conditional. If the conditions specified in the Description cell is met, the value specified in this row shall be provided. Otherwise, it can be provided unless the Description specifically prohibits it, in which case it shall not be provided.
* Optional. The value specified in this row can be provided.


*********************
Key Word requirements
