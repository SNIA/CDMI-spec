Create a Container Object using HTTP
************************************

Synopsis
--------

To create a new container object, the following request shall be performed:

* ``PUT <root URI>/<ContainerName>/<ContainerObjectName>/``

Where:

* ``<root URI>`` is the path to the CDMI cloud.
* ``<ContainerName>`` is zero or more intermediate container objects that already exist, with one slash (i.e., "/") between each pair of container object names.
* ``<ContainerObjectName>`` is the name specified for the container object to be created.

After it is created, the container object shall also be accessible at ``<root URI>/cdmi_objectid/<objectID>/``.

The presence of a trailing slash at the end of the HTTP PUT URI indicates that a container object is being created and distinguishes it from a request to create a data object.

The following capability describes the supported operations that may be performed when creating a new container object:
