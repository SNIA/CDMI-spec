Data objects are the fundamental storage components within CDMIâ„¢ and are analogous to files in a file system.

As CDMI builds on top of, and is compatible with, the HTTP standard (:rfc:`2616`), this allows unmodified HTTP clients to communicate with a CDMI server. This also 
allows CDMI operations to coexist with other HTTP-based storage protocols, such as WebDAV, S3, and OpenStack Swift. 

A CDMI server differentiates between HTTP and CDMI operations using the standard Content-Type and Accept headers. When CDMI MIME types defined in :rfc:`6208` are 
used in these headers, this indicates that CDMI behaviors, as described in :numref:`Clause %s <clause_cdmi_data_object>`, are used in addition to the standard 
HTTP behaviors. When CDMI MIME types are used, the X-CDMI-Specification-Version header is included to indicate which version of CDMI is being requested by the 
client and provided by the server. 

In CDMI 1.0.2, basic HTTP operations were described as "Non-CDMI" operations to distinguish them from operations using CDMI MIME types.

A CDMI implementation that supports data objects shall include support for basic data object HTTP operations corresponding with the CDMI capabilities that are 
published by the implementation. Capabilities allow a client to discover which operations (such as create, update, delete, etc.) are supported and are described in :numref:`Clause %s <Capability-Object-Resource-Operations-using-CDMI>`.
