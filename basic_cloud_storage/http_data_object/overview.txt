Overview
********

Data objects are the fundamental storage components within CDMIâ„¢ and are analogous to files in a file system.

As CDMI builds on top of, and is compatible with, the HTTP standard (:rfc:`2616`), this allows unmodified HTTP clients to communicate with a CDMI server. This also allows CDMI operations to coexist with other HTTP-based storage protocols, such as WebDAV, S3, and OpenStack Swift. 

A CDMI server differentiates between HTTP and CDMI operations using the standard Content-Type and Accept headers. When CDMI MIME types defined in :rfc:`6208` are used in these headers, this indicates that CDMI behaviors, as described in :numref:`clause %s <clause_cdmi_data_object>`, are used in addition to the standard HTTP behaviors.

In CDMI 1.0.2, basic HTTP operations were described as "Non-CDMI" operations to distinguish them from operations using CDMI MIME types.

A CDMI implementation that supports data objects shall include support for basic data object HTTP operations corresponding with the CDMI capabilities that are published by the implementation. Capabilities allow a client to discover which operations (such as create, update, delete, etc.) are supported and are described in :numref:`clause %s <clause_cdmi_container_object>`.

Ciphertext representation of encrypted objects are created, accessed, and updated by explicitelyspecifying a MIME type "``application/cms``" or "``application/jose+json``". Otherwise, a plaintext representation is created, accessed, and updated. For more details on encrypted updates, see :numref:`clause %s <clause_cdmi_encrypted_objects>`.
