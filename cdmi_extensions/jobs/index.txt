CDMI Extension
==============================================

Jobs CDMI Extension
*******************

Overview
--------

Some CDMI systems allow jobs (such as deletion, changing metadata, scanning for viruses, etc.) to be performed against CDMI objects. In such a system, multiple jobs may be performed simultaneously against the same or multiple objects. In these systems, the client needs be able to track the status of a job separately from the objects on which the jobs act. Jobs can also be batched, and a method is needed to track the status for the batch job independently of individual jobs that comprise the batch job.

This extension proposes a new type of data object to handle these requirements. The job data object (extended in a similar manner as a query queue object) can be used to define, perform, and track job status independently from the objects on which the job is acting.

Instructions to the Editor

To merge this extension into the CDMI 2.0.0 specification, make the following changes:

1. Insert into preamble/terms.txt, as follows:

.. glossary::

    x.x
    job
         |br| a data object that defines and manages one or more job actions that can be performed against one or more CDMI objects (job targets) |br|

    x.x
    job action
         |br| a specific change in state performed on a per CDMI object basis as a consequence of a job being run against a CDMI object

         Note: Examples include deletion, metadata changes, thumbnail creation, etc. |br|
         
    x.x
    job container
         |br| a CDMI container object that is capable of storing CDMI job objects |br|
         
    x.x

Jobs

Job Management
--------------

A cloud storage system may optionally implement job management functionality. Job implementation is indicated by the presence of the cloud storage system-wide capabilities for jobs and requires support for CDMI data objects.

Jobs allow arbitrary system-defined actions (such as deletion, metadata changes, thumbnail creation, virus scanning, etc.) to be performed against one or more stored CDMI objects. In addition, multiple jobs may perform actions against a single CDMI object. By creating a well-defined "job" object, clients can define jobs, specify which action is to be performed, specify which objects the action is to be performed against, monitor the status, and control the operation of the job in an interoperable and extensible manner.

In addition, multiple jobs may be batched together to apply actions sequentially for each target CDMI object. Such a batch job may affect multiple objects, and each job may progress at a different rate. The client cares about the overall status of its job, not the status on each object that the job affects. Tracking the job completion status in the ``completionStatus`` and ``percentComplete`` fields of the data object as described in Section 8.2 is not adequate for such systems.

These problems are solved by tracking the job status in a separate CDMI job data object. The job data object provides access to the completion status and percent complete of the job itself, along with other information required to define, monitor, and control the job.

Jobs may be stored in container objects or may exist as standalone data objects with no parent container.

Cloud storage systems should consider implementing support for job data objects when the system supports the following types of client-controlled activities:

* Server-side transformative operations: If the system allows a client to request that an operation be performed against a CDMI data object, the user should initiate and manage the operation through the jobs interface.
* Batch jobs: When running batch jobs that include multiple individual actions, the user needs to track the status for the jobs as the aggregate of the independent tasks.
* Multi-threading: If multiple jobs can be performed on the same object simultaneously, the user needs to track the status of each job independently.
* Long-running jobs: If jobs are run continuously, the user needs to be able to monitor and control the job.

Job Creation
------------

When a client wishes to create a job data object, it may first check if the system is capable of providing job functionality by checking for the presence of the ``cdmi_jobs`` capability in the root container capabilities. If this capability is not present, creating a job data object shall be successful, but no job action shall be performed.

Jobs may be created by CDMI clients and from CDMI internal processes. Examples of jobs created by CDMI clients may include:

* deleting data,
* updating metadata, and
* serialization.

CDMI clients may create jobs through a variety of methods. The user may perform an HTTP operation such as a PUT or POST on a specific object in the cloud. The management framework may intercept and process the requests as an asynchronous job. The system shall create a job in a job container and return an HTTP response code of 202 Accepted. The URI for the job shall be included in an HTTP response header field named “X-CDMI-Job”. <FIXME>

A client may directly create a job through a POST or a PUT of a new job data object. The semantics for this are the same as other data objects. The container that accepts the job must have the ``cdmi_job_dataobject`` capability. The job-specific metadata shall be included in the request and response messages.

Examples of jobs created from internal system processes may include:

* data migration,
* virus scans,
* search indexing, and
* periodic backups.

Although a user does not directly initiate these jobs, they can be exposed to the user since these jobs affect data in the system and consume system resources. Jobs that the system creates are created in a job container. To get a list of system-created jobs, clients can query the children of the container.

Job Object Metadata
-------------------

When a client creates a job data object, the presence of the metadata item ``cdmi_job_state`` indicates that the data object represents a job.

Metadata, including the ``cdmi_job_state`` metadata item may be changed by a client. If the ``cdmi_job_state`` metadata item is removed, that indicates that the job data object shall no longer manage jobs; instead, it shall be treated as a regular CDMI data object by the CDMI server.

The metadata items for a job data object are shown in :numref:`tbl_cdmi_job_data_object_metadata`. 

.. tabularcolumns:: |>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}\Y{0.29}
                    |>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}\Y{0.09}

Examples
--------

EXAMPLE 1: A CDMI job value that deletes three CDMI objects, then immediately deletes itself:

    .. code-block:: none

      {
        "cdmi_job_action" : "cdmi_job_action_delete",
        "cdmi_job_target" : [
            "/cdmi_objectid/00007ED900100DA32EC94351F8970400",
            "/cdmi_objectid/00007ED90010F077F4EB1C99C87524CC",
            "/cdmi_objectid/00007ED90010512EB55A9304EAC5D4AA"
        ],
        "cdmi_job_autodelete" : "0"
      }

EXAMPLE 2: A CDMI job value that deletes every object enqueued into a notification queue:

    .. code-block:: none

      {
        "cdmi_job_action" : "cdmi_job_action_delete",
        "cdmi_job_target" : "/container/jobs/created_mp3_files_queue"
      }

Jobs can be used in combination with query and notification queues to perform an action against each query result or notification result.

Job Lifecycle
-------------

The defined job status and transitions between status is shown in :numref:`fig_JobLifecycle`.

.. _fig_JobLifecycle:

.. figure:: /images/cdmi_job_lifecycle.pdf
    :align:  center
    :figwidth: 100%
   
    Job Lifecycle

The following status values will be reflected in the ``cdmi_job_status`` field of the job data object:

``Pending``, ``Active``, ``Idle``, ``Completed``, ``Error``, and ``Canceled``.

The job is created in the ``Pending`` state. If it is started, it moves to the ``Active`` state. The job may optionally move between the ``Active`` and ``Idle`` states; however, all systems may not support the ``Idle`` state. The job moves to ``Completed``, ``Error``, or ``Canceled`` once it is finished. The ``Canceled`` state is optional, as it may not make sense in some systems. After completion, the job is retained until the client deletes the job or until the ``cdmi_job_autodelete`` period elapses.
The system shall permit the client to start, pause, restart, or cancel a job using the ``cdmi_job_state`` metadata item. This functionality is optional, as the ability to directly control a job depends on the system.

.. _ref_job_actions:

Job Actions
-----------

A client shall use the ``cdmi_jobs_actions`` system-wide capability to discover which job actions are supported.

Job actions defined in this international standard are shown in :numref:`tbl_cdmi_job_actions`. 

.. tabularcolumns:: |>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}\Y{0.40}
                    |>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}\Y{0.60}|

.. _tbl_cdmi_job_actions:

.. list-table:: Job actions
    :class: longtable
    :header-rows: 1
    :align: center 

    * - Job Action
      - Description
    * - ``cdmi_job_action_sequential_batch``
      - Sequential batch jobs perform two or more jobs one after another against each targeted CDMI object in a specified order.

          * Sequential batch jobs have the job action identifier of ``cdmi_job_action_batch_sequential``.
          * The action parameters are an ordered JSON array of URIs to other job data objects that define the individual operations to be performed.

        Each of these component jobs shall not have a ``job_target`` or ``job_state``, as the ``job_target`` and ``job_state`` of the sequential batch job shall be used instead.
    * - ``cdmi_job_action_parallel_batch``
      - Parallel batch jobs perform two or more individual jobs in any order or at the same time against each targeted CDMI object. Parallel batch jobs should only perform job actions that do not alter the target data objects, or unspecified results may occur.

          * Parallel batch jobs have the job action identifier of ``cdmi_job_action_batch_parallel``.
          * The action parameters are a JSON array of URIs to other job data objects that define the individual operations to be performed.

        Each of these component jobs shall not have a ``job_target`` or ``job_state``, as the ``job_target`` and ``job_state`` of the parallel batch job shall be used instead.
    * - ``cdmi_job_action_delete``
      - Deletion jobs delete the target CDMI objects.

          * Delete jobs have the job action identifier of ``cdmi_job_action_delete``.
          * No job action parameters are required.

    * - ``cdmi_job_action_update_metadata``
      - Update metadata jobs manipulate the metadata of target CDMI objects.

          * Update metadata jobs have the job action identifier of ``cdmi_job_action_update_metadata``.
          * The action parameters are an JSON object that contain or or more of the below three JSON containers:
          * 1. The ``update_add`` contains metadata items to be added to the data object if they don't already exist;
          * 2. The ``update_modify`` contains metadata items to be overwritten if they already exist; and
          * 3. The ``update_delete`` contains metadata items to be removed from the data object.

Job Containers
--------------

CDMI job container objects store job data objects. Use of job containers is optional in CDMI systems but is mandatory if clients are permitted to create job data objects.

Job containers may be dedicated to storing only job data objects, or they may store other containers and data objects, including job data objects. CDMI systems may automatically create job containers, and in such systems, CDMI clients may not have the ability to create or delete job containers. Other systems may allow CDMI clients to create or delete job containers that support storing job data objects that the system or CDMI clients create.

A CDMI system may create and implement a single, global jobs container that CDMI clients cannot change. If present, clients can locate this global jobs container by the URI specified by the ``cdmi_jobs_global_container`` capability described in :numref:`%s <ref_cloud_storage_system>`.

Systems may allow multiple job containers. Jobs may be grouped in containers along with non-job data objects. One use of multiple containers is to group jobs by type. Systems may allow CDMI clients to create their own job containers.

When job containers are supported, a CDMI client shall identify job containers using the ``cdmi_job_container_actions`` data system metadata capability described in :numref:`%s <ref_data_system_metadata_capabilities>`.

The ability of a CDMI client to create a job container object within a container is indicated by the ``cdmi_create_job_container`` container capability described in :numref:`%s <ref_container_capabilities>`. This capability also indicates any restrictions on job actions for a created child job container.

Once a job container has been created, the data system metadata of the ``cdmi_job_container_actions_provided`` contains an array of JSON strings that indicate the allowable actions that can be requested for job data objects that are created within that job container (see :numref:`%s <ref_support_for_provided_data_system_metadata>`). The system generates this list depending on which actions are supported and which actions are requested in the data system metadata of the ``cdmi_job_container_actions`` described in :numref:`%s <ref_support_for_data_system_metadata>`.

A system may allow jobs to be created or deleted within a job container. This function is indicated by the capabilities associated with the job container.

* The ability of a CDMI client to create a job data object within a job container is indicated by the ``cdmi_create_job_dataobject`` container capability described in :numref:`%s <ref_container_capabilities>`.
* The ability of a CDMI client to delete a job data object within a job container is indicated by the ``cdmi_delete_dataobject`` data object capability described in :numref:`%s <ref_cdata_object_capabilities>`.

Using capabilities and data system metadata, the client follows these steps to create a new job container that allows jobs for deleting CDMI objects:

1. Examine the presence and value of the ``cdmi_create_job_container`` capability of the parent container to see if child job containers can be created and if the cdmi_job_action_delete action is supported.
2. If job container creation is supported and the ``cdmi_job_action_delete`` action is supported, create a new child container with the ``cdmi_job_container_actions`` data system metadata set to ``ALL`` (or include the value ``cdmi_job_action_delete``) to indicate to the server that job data objects with delete job actions will be created in this newly created container.
3. Examine the ``cdmi_job_container_actions_provided`` data system metadata of the newly created container to ensure that ``cdmi_job_action_delete`` is included in the list.
4. Examine the ``cdmi_create_job_dataobject`` capability of the newly created container to ensure that job creation is supported.
5. If job data object creation is supported and the desired action is supported, create a new child data object with ``cdmi_jobs_action`` metadata supporting the cdmi_job_action_delete job action.

EXAMPLE 3: An example of the job metadata associated with a job container that indicates that only delete action jobs can be created is as follows:

    .. code-block:: none

      {
        "metadata" : {
          "cdmi_job_container_actions" : [ "ALL" ],
          "cdmi_job_container_actions_provided" : [ "cdmi_job_action_delete" ]
        ]
      }
