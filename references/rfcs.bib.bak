SCSI protocols are request/response application protocols with a common standardized architecture model and basic command set, as well as standardized command sets for different device classes (disks, tapes, media-changers etc.). As system interconnects move from the classical bus structure to a network structure, SCSI has to be mapped to network transport protocols.
