CDMI snapshots
==============

Overview
********

A snapshot is a point-in-time copy (image) of a container and all of its contents, including subcontainers and all data objects and queue objects. The client names a snapshot of a container at the time the snapshot is requested. A snapshot operation creates a new container to contain the point-in-time image. The first processing of a snapshot operation also adds a ``cdmi_snapshots`` child container to the source container. Each new snapshot container is added as a child of the ``cdmi_snapshots`` container. The snapshot does not include the ``cdmi_snapshots`` child container or its contents (see :numref:`fig_snapshot_container_structure`).

Creating a snapshot
*******************

Operation context
-----------------

A snapshot operation is requested using the container update operation (see :numref:`%s <ref_cdmi_container_object_update>`), in which the snapshot field specifies the requested name of the snapshot.

A snapshot may be accessed in the same way that any other CDMIâ„¢ object is accessed. An important use of a snapshot is to allow the contents of the source container to be restored to their values at a previous point in time using a CDMI copy operation. 

Example
-------

EXAMPLE 1: PATCH to an existing container to create a snapshot:

   .. code-block:: none

       --> PATCH /cdmi/2.0.0/MyContainer/ HTTP/1.1
       --> Host: cloud.example.com
       --> Content-Type: application/cdmi-container
       --> 
       --> {
       -->   "snapshot" : "MySnapshot"
       --> }
       
       <-- HTTP/1.1 201 Created


Deleting a snapshot
*******************

Operation context
-----------------

A snapshot can be deleted by performing a CDMI container delete operation on the corresponding child container in the ``cdmi_snapshots`` container, or by performing a CDMI container delete operation on the snapshot Object ID.

Example
-------

EXAMPLE 1: DELETE to an existing snapshot:

   .. code-block:: none

       --> DELETE /cdmi/2.0.0/MyContainer/cdmi_snapshots/MySnapshot HTTP/1.1
       --> Host: cloud.example.com
       
       <-- HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
