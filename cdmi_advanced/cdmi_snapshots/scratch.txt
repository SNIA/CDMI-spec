========================================

A snapshot is a point-in-time copy (image) of a container and all of its contents, including subcontainers and all data objects and queue objects. The client names a snapshot of a container at the time the snapshot is requested. A snapshot operation creates a new container to contain the point-in-time image. The first processing of a snapshot operation also adds a cdmi_snapshots child container to the source container. Each new snapshot container is added as a child of the cdmi_snapshots container. The snapshot does not include the cdmi_snapshots child container or its contents (see :ref:`Snapshot Container Structure`).

A snapshot operation is requested using the container update operation (see :ref:`Update a Container Object using CDMI`), in which the snapshot field specifies the requested name of the snapshot.

A snapshot may be accessed in the same way that any other CDMIâ„¢ object is accessed. An important use of a snapshot is to allow the contents of the source container to be restored to their values at a previous point in time using a CDMI copy operation.
