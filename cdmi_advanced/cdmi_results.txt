.. _clause_cdmi_results:

Results specification
=====================

Overview
********

CDMIâ„¢ provides a standardized mechanism to define subsets of object contents. This mechanism is known as a CDMI results specification. Results specifications are typically used to provide a CDMI client with a way to indicate on what subset of the contents of CDMI objects it intends to retrieve or operate.

Each JSON object within the results specification represents a set of fields that are returned for each matching object.

The results JSON object shall be constructed using the same structure as is used for CDMI objects. To show this, assume the following result from a GET for a data object:

.. code-block:: none

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/cdmi-object
        
        {
            "objectType" : "application/cdmi-object",
            "objectID" : "00007E7F0010EB9092B29F6CD6AD6824",
            "objectName" : "MyDataObject.txt",
            "parentURI" : "/MyContainer/",
            "parentID" : "00007E7F00102E230ED82694DAA975D2",
            "domainURI" : "/cdmi_domains/MyDomain/",
            "capabilitiesURI" : "/cdmi_capabilities/dataobject/",
            "completionStatus" : "Complete",
            "mimetype" : "text/plain",
            "metadata" : {
                "cdmi_size" : "108263",
                    ...
            },
            "valuerange" : "0-108262",
            "value" : "..."
        }

Examples
********

Each field inside a results specification JSON object indicates that the field shall be included in the results. 

EXAMPLE 1: The following results specification requests that the ``objectID`` and ``cdmi_size`` metadata fields be returned in the results:

    .. code-block:: none

        {
            "cdmi_results_specification" : {
                "objectID" : "",
                "metadata" : {
                    "cdmi_size" : "" 
                } 
            } 
        } 


EXAMPLE 2: If an object is matched, the result JSON is enqueued as follows:

    .. code-block:: none

        {
            "objectID" : "00007E7F0010EB9092B29F6CD6AD6824",
            "metadata" : {
                "cdmi_size" : "108263" 
            } 
        } 

For most common use cases, clients request either the ``objectID``, the ``objectName`` and ``parentURI``, or all three fields in the ``cdmi_results_specification``. If the ``parentURI`` or ``objectName`` is requested, the field shall only be returned for objects existing in a container object.


EXAMPLE 3: To request all metadata items be returned for each matching object, the following ``cdmi_results_specification`` shall be used: 

    .. code-block:: none

        {
            "cdmi_results_specification" : {
                "metadata" : "" 
            } 
        }


EXAMPLE 4: To request all fields and all metadata items be returned for each matching object, the following ``cdmi_results_specification`` shall be used:

    .. code-block:: none

        {
            "cdmi_results_specification" : "" 
        }  

The ``value`` field is always returned in base 64 encoding when included in a query result, where the ``valuetransferencoding`` field indicates the encoding that should be expected if a GET to read the object is performed.
